	<h1>NETWORK TYPES:</h1>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-5 col-sm-12 "><section id="i1">Local Area Network</section><p>A local area network (LAN) is usually privately owned and connects some hosts in a single office, building, orcampus.Each host in a LAN has an identifier, an address, that uniquely defines the host in the LAN.A packet sent by a host to another host carries both the source host’s and the destination host’s addresses.In the past, all hosts in a network were connected through a common cable, which meant that a packet sent from one host to another was received by all hosts.The intended recipient kept the packet, the others dropped the packet.

		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-5 col-sm-12 "><section id="i1">Wide Area Network</section><p>A wide area network (WAN)is also an interconnection of devices capable of communication.However, there are some differences between a LAN and a WAN.a WAN has a wider geographical span, a town, a state, a country, or even the world.A LAN interconnects hosts;a WAN interconnects connecting devices such as switches, routers, or modems.A LAN is normally privately owned by the organization that uses it.Two distinct examples of WANs today: point-to-point WANs and switchedWANs.</p></div>
		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-12 col-sm-12 "><section id="i1">Internet Switching</section><p>An internet is a switched network in which a switch connects at least two links together.A switch needs to forward data from a network to another network when required.The two most common types of switched networks are circuit-switched and packet-switched networks.In a circuit-switched network, a dedicated connection, called a circuit, is always available between the two endsystems; the switch can only make it active or inactive.A router in a packet-switched network has a queue that can store and forward the packet.</p></div>
